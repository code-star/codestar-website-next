Important tools for ProRail Traffic Control for control of non-centrally served areas and the port railway line. Shunting and Stabling became an important theme for traffic control in the early years. &#x27;Feniks&#x27; will play an important role in this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this session Peter likes to talk about his adventures, mainly with Angular and NgRx, and the lessons he learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Important topics to be covered about Angular are: Project structure, design principles, State management (NgRx 15), Standalone components and Signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Twan Koot / Michiel Hamers - Design for costs, four pillars of economic Cloud design**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers are being exposed to things like FinOps or a massive Azure bill.

By incorporating our four pillars of economic cloud design you are able to design cost efficient and high performant cloud solutions. l&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will of course also explain &quot;Zero User Costs&quot; and &quot;Geo Efficiency&quot; so you can start today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Mark Abrahams - Autonomous Teams**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Become autonomous and get rid of those brittle, time consuming end-to-end tests&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our ever-growing application landscape, end to end/chain tests become more and more time consuming. Not only the execution time is increasing but also the amount of work to figure out what line of code is causing the issue. Not even to mention the time, money, and complexity it takes to create and maintain a representative test environment containing the right versions of the microservices at the right time for the test.&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Azure Static Web Apps - From Zero to Deployed App In 60 Minutes</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re very happy to host this talk by Stacy Cashmore. Whether you&#x27;re a front-end developer that wants to tip their toes in Blazor or a back-end developer looking for a way to easily create web applications, this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**About the talk**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re told that by using services such as Medium, dev.to etc. we are diluting our personal brand. That we should be posting to our own site and building ourselves up. You can, of course, use off-the-shelf applications to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or… You can use it as an exercise to try something new and learn new skills!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this session, we will look at doing just that! Starting with an empty GitHub repository we are going to make a Blazor WebAssembly application to act as our website. We’ll connect that to an Azure Function that reads posts from a CosmosDB to pass to that site. Then we’ll deploy that to a production Azure Static Web App.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, when developing an application, it’s useful to be able to run it locally. So, we’ll also look at how we can do that with Azure Static Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to be able to write new blog posts, we need to be able to authenticate ourselves and provide proper authorization so that this functionality can be added later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**About Stacy**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaker, author, and software developer. Stacy has been developing solutions since the mid-1990s in various companies and industries ranging from facilitating contract jobbing to allowing consumers to close a mortgage without the help of a financial adviser – with lots in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has a passion for sharing knowledge: using storytelling for sharing her experiences to help teams grow in the ways that they develop software and work together and performing live coding demonstrations to inspire others to try new technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stacy has just published her first book, aimed at helping developers get started building dynamic applications using C#, Azure Functions, and Azure Static Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For her effort in the community, Stacy has been awarded the Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Programme**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;17:30 Walk in&lt;br/&gt;18:00 Dinner&lt;br/&gt;18:45 Talk part 1&lt;br/&gt;19:25 Break&lt;br/&gt;19:40 Talk part 2 + Q&amp;amp;A&lt;br/&gt;20:20 Drinks&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>DENGUG</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;Dutch Enterprise Angular User Group meeting, discussing experiences and issues when working with the Angular Ecosystem in enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representatives with enterprise experience from several companies are invited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Core topics include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* Nx monorepos&lt;br/&gt;* NgRx state management, SHARI and DUGSA principles&lt;br/&gt;* Testing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Places are limited, that&#x27;s why contact information is required.

During assignments Paul is always busy with sharing his knowledge, for instance through coding dojo&#x27;s and talks. He searches for new knowledge in other people, books, experiences, videos and practicing. When he learnes something new he is exited to pass it on to everybody who wants to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more. You can expect a talk with a lot of code examples and practical advise that you can use the next day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Program;&lt;br/&gt;18:00 Dinner&lt;br/&gt;18:45 Start talk Paul van der Slot&lt;br/&gt;19:45 Drinks&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Code &amp; Comedy register @https://www.codeandcomedy.com/</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;[Code &amp;amp; Comedy - 2022](&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeandcomedy.com/event-details/code-comedy-2022&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;https://www.codeandcomedy.com/event-details/code-comedy-2022&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;Code &amp;amp; Comedy the place to be for interesting talks about software craftmanship combined with comedy for some great laughs.

When he learnes something new he is exited to pass it on to everybody who wants to know.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more.
