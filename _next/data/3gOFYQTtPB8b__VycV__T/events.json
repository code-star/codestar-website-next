Ansible Lightspeed (including IBM Watson Code Assistant) is a generative AI tool which makes it easier for developers to automate tasks in Ansible playbooks and create Ansible content.

In this presentation, I will show you how easy it is to create, version, share, and publish Helm Charts. So, start using Helm and stop the copy-and-pasting. Along the way, you will discover the real benefits that lay in the role it plays in streamlining your CI/CD pipelines. Helm automatically maintains a database of all the versions of your releases. So, whenever something goes wrong during deployment, rolling back to the previous version is just one command away. So, let’s take a deep dive into Helm charts, templates, and functions: Kubernetes deployments done right!</p> <p>**Rick Hutten**<br/>**Simplifying Concurrency with Project Loom: A Journey with Pizza-chef Fabio**<br/>Project Loom, a groundbreaking feature within OpenJDK, introduces a lightweight and versatile concurrency model for Java. Understanding concurrency can be challenging, especially for non-technical individuals and novice developers. In this session, we embark on an adventure alongside Fabio, a passionate pizza-chef facing similar challenges in his upscale restaurant as those encountered in multithreading on a CPU. We delve into concepts such as CPU threads, virtual threads, and structured concurrency, making them accessible to listeners of all proficiency levels. Attendees will not only learn to recognize the use cases of these techniques but also gain insights into how and if Project Loom can enhance their application.</p> <p>**Kaya Weers**<br/>**A design pattern goes to the supermarket**<br/>Everybody knows the term design patterns. Some know the patterns and correct implementation by heart. Others vaguely recognize the pattern names but don’t recall the details. This talk is intended for the latter group.<br/>I’ll dive into a couple of design patterns using real-life examples. What would a design pattern look like in day-to-day life? We’ll follow Bobby and Billie and discover how a design pattern would behave in a non-digital environment: the supermarket! With the help of drawings, this talk will give you a solid understanding of design patterns, so you won't have to look them up ever again!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":516824538,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/f/a/highres_516824538.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/f/a/600_516824538.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/f/a/thumb_516824538.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},{"created":1698153898000,"duration":14400000,"id":"296928992","name":"Tech Women Connect","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1700751600000,"local_date":"2023-11-23","local_time":"16:00","updated":1700771737000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":17,"venue":{"id":24315864,"name":"Ordina HQ ","lat":52.05641174316406,"lon":5.110540866851807,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/296928992/","description":"<p>On the 23*rd* of November we are organizing the Tech Women Connect event at the Ordina office in Utrecht(Nieuwegein), it’s an inspiring gathering that celebrates and empowers women in the tech industry.</p> <p>In the last four decades, there has been increasingly more attention on the participation of women in male-dominated sectors, such as IT — another milestone to celebrate. However, women in male-dominated careers still face challenges today.<br/>Modern day workforces are moving in the right direction, yet many women are not experiencing the benefits.
