Whether you're a front-end developer that wants to tip their toes in Blazor or a back-end developer looking for a way to easily create web applications, this talk is for you!</p> <p>**About the talk**</p> <p>We're told that by using services such as Medium, dev.to etc. we are diluting our personal brand. That we should be posting to our own site and building ourselves up. You can, of course, use off-the-shelf applications to do that for you.</p> <p>Or… You can use it as an exercise to try something new and learn new skills!</p> <p>In this session, we will look at doing just that! Starting with an empty GitHub repository we are going to make a Blazor WebAssembly application to act as our website. We’ll connect that to an Azure Function that reads posts from a CosmosDB to pass to that site. Then we’ll deploy that to a production Azure Static Web App.</p> <p>Of course, when developing an application, it’s useful to be able to run it locally. So, we’ll also look at how we can do that with Azure Static Web Apps.</p> <p>Finally, in order to be able to write new blog posts, we need to be able to authenticate ourselves and provide proper authorization so that this functionality can be added later.</p> <p>**About Stacy**</p> <p>Speaker, author, and software developer. Stacy has been developing solutions since the mid-1990s in various companies and industries ranging from facilitating contract jobbing to allowing consumers to close a mortgage without the help of a financial adviser – with lots in between.</p> <p>She has a passion for sharing knowledge: using storytelling for sharing her experiences to help teams grow in the ways that they develop software and work together and performing live coding demonstrations to inspire others to try new technologies.</p> <p>Stacy has just published her first book, aimed at helping developers get started building dynamic applications using C#, Azure Functions, and Azure Static Web Apps.</p> <p>For her effort in the community, Stacy has been awarded the Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2020.</p> <p>**Programme**</p> <p>17:30 Walk in<br/>18:00 Dinner<br/>18:45 Talk part 1<br/>19:25 Break<br/>19:40 Talk part 2 + Q&amp;A<br/>20:20 Drinks</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":507692611,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/6/3/highres_507692611.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/6/3/600_507692611.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/6/3/thumb_507692611.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},{"created":1658125967000,"duration":7200000,"id":"287258312","name":"DENGUG","rsvp_limit":12,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1663257600000,"local_date":"2022-09-15","local_time":"18:00","updated":1663268499000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":3,"venue":{"id":24315864,"name":"Ordina HQ ","lat":52.05641174316406,"lon":5.110540866851807,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/287258312/","description":"<p>Dutch Enterprise Angular User Group meeting, discussing experiences and issues when working with the Angular Ecosystem in enterprise environments.</p> <p>Representatives with enterprise experience from several companies are invited.</p> <p>Core topics include:</p> <p>* Nx monorepos<br/>* NgRx state management, SHARI and DUGSA principles<br/>* Testing</p> <p>Places are limited, that's why contact information is required.

During assignments Paul is always busy with sharing his knowledge, for instance through coding dojo's and talks. He searches for new knowledge in other people, books, experiences, videos and practicing. When he learnes something new he is exited to pass it on to everybody who wants to know.</p> <p>I always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more. You can expect a talk with a lot of code examples and practical advise that you can use the next day.</p> <p>Program;<br/>18:00 Dinner<br/>18:45 Start talk Paul van der Slot<br/>19:45 Drinks</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1652082935000,"duration":21600000,"id":"285794683","name":"Code & Comedy register @https://www.codeandcomedy.com/","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1655391600000,"local_date":"2022-06-16","local_time":"17:00","updated":1655415168000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":24315864,"name":"Ordina HQ ","lat":52.05641174316406,"lon":5.110540866851807,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/285794683/","description":"<p>[Code &amp; Comedy - 2022](<a href=\"https://www.codeandcomedy.com/event-details/code-comedy-2022\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.codeandcomedy.com/event-details/code-comedy-2022</a>)<br/>Code &amp; Comedy the place to be for interesting talks about software craftmanship combined with comedy for some great laughs.

That makes them more straightforward and lightweight. While the principles behind this new feature are quickly understood, the really interesting question is: How can applications be structured without NgModules?</p> <p>You will get an answer to exactly this question here. After showing the basics and mental model of Standalone Component (Pipes and Directives), you see several approaches for structuring your application and for grouping related building blocks. We also go into edge cases for lazy loading and the use of existing libraries based on NgModules. We discuss the interaction with tree-shakable providers and how you can convert existing solutions step by step to Standalone Components.</p> <p>Manfred Steyer, Google Developer Expert for Angular</p> <p>Manfred Steyer (GDE) is an architect, trainer and consultant for software development with focus on web-based enterprise solutions and architectures with Angular.</p> <p>Before that, he worked for around ten years as a project and team leader in the field of software development and then, in parallel to his work as a trainer and consultant, for around eight years as a university professor for software engineering.</p> <p>Manfred studied part-time IT (Diploma) in Graz (Austria) and also part-time Computer Science (Master’s) in Hagen (Germany).
