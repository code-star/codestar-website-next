During assignments Paul is always busy with sharing his knowledge, for instance through coding dojo's and talks. He searches for new knowledge in other people, books, experiences, videos and practicing. When he learnes something new he is exited to pass it on to everybody who wants to know.</p> <p>I always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more. You can expect a talk with a lot of code examples and practical advise that you can use the next day.</p> <p>Program;<br/>18:00 Dinner<br/>18:45 Start talk Paul van der Slot<br/>19:45 Drinks</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1652082935000,"duration":21600000,"id":"285794683","name":"Code & Comedy register @https://www.codeandcomedy.com/","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1655391600000,"local_date":"2022-06-16","local_time":"17:00","updated":1655415168000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/285794683/","description":"<p>[Code &amp; Comedy - 2022](<a href=\"https://www.codeandcomedy.com/event-details/code-comedy-2022\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.codeandcomedy.com/event-details/code-comedy-2022</a>)<br/>Code &amp; Comedy the place to be for interesting talks about software craftmanship combined with comedy for some great laughs.

That makes them more straightforward and lightweight. While the principles behind this new feature are quickly understood, the really interesting question is: How can applications be structured without NgModules?</p> <p>You will get an answer to exactly this question here. After showing the basics and mental model of Standalone Component (Pipes and Directives), you see several approaches for structuring your application and for grouping related building blocks. We also go into edge cases for lazy loading and the use of existing libraries based on NgModules. We discuss the interaction with tree-shakable providers and how you can convert existing solutions step by step to Standalone Components.</p> <p>Manfred Steyer, Google Developer Expert for Angular</p> <p>Manfred Steyer (GDE) is an architect, trainer and consultant for software development with focus on web-based enterprise solutions and architectures with Angular.</p> <p>Before that, he worked for around ten years as a project and team leader in the field of software development and then, in parallel to his work as a trainer and consultant, for around eight years as a university professor for software engineering.</p> <p>Manfred studied part-time IT (Diploma) in Graz (Austria) and also part-time Computer Science (Masterâ€™s) in Hagen (Germany).
