During assignments Paul is always busy with sharing his knowledge, for instance through coding dojo's and talks. He searches for new knowledge in other people, books, experiences, videos and practicing. When he learnes something new he is exited to pass it on to everybody who wants to know.</p> <p>I always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more.

That makes them more straightforward and lightweight. While the principles behind this new feature are quickly understood, the really interesting question is: How can applications be structured without NgModules?</p> <p>You will get an answer to exactly this question here. After showing the basics and mental model of Standalone Component (Pipes and Directives), you see several approaches for structuring your application and for grouping related building blocks. We also go into edge cases for lazy loading and the use of existing libraries based on NgModules. We discuss the interaction with tree-shakable providers and how you can convert existing solutions step by step to Standalone Components.</p> <p>Manfred Steyer, Google Developer Expert for Angular</p> <p>Manfred Steyer (GDE) is an architect, trainer and consultant for software development with focus on web-based enterprise solutions and architectures with Angular.</p> <p>Before that, he worked for around ten years as a project and team leader in the field of software development and then, in parallel to his work as a trainer and consultant, for around eight years as a university professor for software engineering.</p> <p>Manfred studied part-time IT (Diploma) in Graz (Austria) and also part-time Computer Science (Master’s) in Hagen (Germany).

Modern music would sound very different without synthesisers, samples and software sequencers. This time at Codestar Night, we want to explore some less obvious applications for software in music. We have two spectacular speakers, both developers and one of them a musician.</p> <p>Be prepared for smart scripts for music notation and live coding to create real-time music!</p> <p># Tidal by Alex McClean</p> <p>Alex has been making music with Haskell for many years, mainly with his free/open source environment TidalCycles (or Tidal for short; <a href=\"http://tidalcycles.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://tidalcycles.org</a>). He makes music by live coding with Tidal, most often at 'algoraves', where people dance to algorithmic music. Tidal applies pure functional reactive programming principles to represent musical pattern, providing a library of combinators for creating sequences and transforming them in strange ways.</p> <p>Alex will introduce and demonstrate Tidal, and also talk a little about his research work in weaving, where he uses Haskell to explore textile patterns rather than musical ones.</p> <p># Just Code It! by Hamza Haiken</p> <p>You want to code. Good. Now you need an idea. This talk is about inspiration: we'll find something to code, code it together and hopefully learn something along the way. On the menu today: coding a physical music box with punch cards! This will involve setting up a modern Python project, and learning about CLIs, basic music theory, some MIDI, and a bit of drawing. There will even be some types and a dash of poetry.</p> <p>Hamza is a backend developer at Codestar who likes to code wacky things and loves terminals, about which he gave talks at Devoxx and Code &amp; Comedy.</p> <p># Program<br/>22 August 2019<br/>17:30 Doors open and registration<br/>18:00 Food<br/>18:30 Talk 1<br/>19:30 Break<br/>20:00 Talk 2<br/>21:00 Drinks</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":482787398,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/0/6/highres_482787398.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/0/6/600_482787398.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/0/6/thumb_482787398.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},{"created":1560503688000,"duration":28800000,"fee":{"accepts":"cash","amount":500,"currency":"EUR","description":"","label":"Price","required":false},"id":"262310961","name":"Workshop: AWS in a day","rsvp_limit":20,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1562310000000,"local_date":"2019-07-05","local_time":"09:00","rsvp_close_offset":"PT168H","updated":1562340343000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/262310961/","description":"<p>Codestar is hosting the Codecamp \"AWS in a day\" with AWS expert Niels Albers.</p> <p>In this one day workshop, you will learn about:</p> <p>* The overall AWS ecosystem<br/>* How to set up a front- and back-end architecture in AWS<br/>* Using AWS Lambda's to realize an infinitely scalable architecture<br/>* AWS API Gateway for API management<br/>* S3 for storage<br/>* Kinesis for streaming data<br/>* EKS for orchestrating your containerized applications with hosted Kubernetes</p> <p>Don't hesitate to contact us for more information!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":482225008,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/9/0/highres_482225008.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/9/0/600_482225008.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/9/0/thumb_482225008.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},{"created":1555060902000,"duration":14400000,"id":"260564012","name":"Advanced Kotlin","rsvp_limit":60,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1558625400000,"local_date":"2019-05-23","local_time":"17:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT24H","updated":1558645748000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":44,"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/260564012/","description":"<p>These talks are no introduction to Kotlin! We at Codestar love solving challenges with functional and reactive programming. Since Kotlin has been gaining traction we think it is time for some deepdives into elegant solutions to complex matters with Kotlin. We have two talks by developers from the Kotlin community, who have taken it to the next level.</p> <p># Contracts in Kotlin - by Hasan Serdar Çınar<br/>Kotlin 1.3 introduced built-in support for Contracts to improve smart casting. In this talk, we will discover the “Contract Programming” principles and real life implementations. We'll also focus on how Contracts can improve existing projects with the Design by Contract approach.</p> <p># About Serdar<br/>Serdar Cinar is a Principal Mobile Applications developer at Mobiquity with 8+ years of experience in iOS and Android development in various industries. Before mobile he worked as front-end and backend developer. As an Android developer he worked with Java for a long time and now, he Is developing Android apps with Kotlin since Android support started.</p> <p># Kotlin coroutines - by Joost de Vries<br/>Kotlin coroutines: what can you do with them, how do they work and how do they compare to futures and streams?</p> <p>Asynchronous and concurrent programming is hard. Over the years we have tried many things to deal with that: when threads and locks didn't work we tried Futures and Promises, Streams, Actors, you name it. In Kotlin (like in Go before) we can tackle this nasty problem with coroutines, which offer some clear benefits over the other ways of handling asynchronous programming. In this talk you'll learn how to use coroutines, how they work and how they compare to other ways of concurrent/reactive programming.</p> <p># About Joost<br/>Joost has been getting stuff done using functtional reactive programming in Scala and Typescript for 5 years. Most recently he has been working in the logistical domain on events first systems that use stream processing. He enjoys keeping up with the computer science of concurrent programming and distributed systems.<br/>When he’s not developing systems he likes to sing and play the saxophone.

As a security expert, he tells about his experience with plenty of real life examples, making abstract security threats tangible and helping us to counteract them.</p> <p># Web Application Security Testing<br/>You have probably heard of Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection, maybe Phishing - or even all of the OWASP Top 10. But where do these vulnerabilities come from? How are they found by hackers, and how are they created by developers? In this session, we will discuss many of common web application security vulnerabilities, typical development mistakes leading to these issues, and how to use standard tools (such as Burp Suite Proxy) to find them before it's too late!</p> <p># Red-Teaming — What and How?<br/>Red Teaming is an exercise used by many of the most security-conscious and advanced enterprises, but what is the point? We will provide a brief introduction to many of the tools and goals of red teaming exercises, providing you with a basic toolkit with which your overall security posture can be tested. Afterwards, we will walk through an actual assignment which was executed by Secura, in which a developer laptop was obtained, compromised, and then used as a stepping stone into an organisation's network to get to the Crown Jewels!</p> <p># About Michael<br/>Michael has been working in the security industry for over 11 years, focusing on web application penetration testing and code review mostly within the financial sector.

With the paradigms OOP and (our favorite) FP in mind, he will tell us about how to approach development using ECS. Will this turn out to be our new favorite?</p> <p># The nitty gritty of data serialisation<br/>In this talk we will have a close look at data and how we can serialise data for communication and persistence. We will discuss different techniques data serialisation formats employ and how to chose the one which suits you best.</p> <p># Entity Component System - a different approach to game / application development<br/>Entity Component System (ECS) is a software development pattern born in game development. Even though the concept is about 20 years old it is only now, that it is on the brink to becoming mainstream, thanks to the the efforts behind Unity3D game engine. We will discuss how the mental model behind ECS is different, compared to typical OOP and FP approaches and how ECS can help deliver high performance, high throughput interactive applications.</p> <p># About Maxim<br/>Maxim Zaks tells computers how to waste electricity. Hopefully in efficient, or at least useful way.<br/>He worked as IDE developer, Java Consultant in financial sector and mobile games / app developer.<br/>His current obsession is with data serialisation formats and data oriented design.<br/>More about Maxim: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/icex33\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/icex33</a></p> <p># Program<br/>26 September 2018<br/>17:30 Doors open and registration<br/>18:00 Food<br/>18:30 Talk 1<br/>19:30 Break<br/>20:00 Talk 2<br/>21:00 Drinks</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":473173755,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/b/b/highres_473173755.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/b/b/600_473173755.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/b/b/thumb_473173755.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
